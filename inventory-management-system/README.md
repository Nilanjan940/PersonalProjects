## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

- **Page Not Loading?**
  - Ensure XAMPP is running.
  - Verify both **Apache** and **MySQL** services are active.

- **Error: #1046 - No database selected**
  - This means you tried importing the SQL file without first creating the database. Be sure to **create the database before importing**.
